This collaborative project, referred to as #0x11 C - printf, forms a component of the ALX Software Engineering program. 
Its purpose is to imitate the functionality of the printf() function within the C standard library.

The key takeaways from this project include:
1. Gaining knowledge on how to use git in a team environment
2. Applying variadic functions to a larger-scale project
3. Understanding the intricacies involved in implementing the printf function
4. Learning how to manage numerous files and establish an effective workflow.

Thanks!
